# Bikeshare Python Project


### Description
For this project, I had to use Python, along with the Numpy and Pandas modules, to examine and explore data relating to bike share data for 3 different cities across the US - Washington, New York City and Chicago. 
Within this data, it allowed the users to input various commands, which in turn, filtered the data to whatever the user required. 
It also has an option for the user to view the raw data files. 

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
